# Role default lower priority variables

# List of dicts with limits to configure. The dicts have the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible pam_limits module. For example:
#
# limits:
#   - domain: *
#     limit_type: hard
#     limit_item: fsize
#     value: 1000000
#     use_max: yes

limits: []

# Dicitionary with the defaults options to use if no other ones are specified in
# the `limits` variable. The members of the dict are the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible pam_limits module

limits_defaults: {}
